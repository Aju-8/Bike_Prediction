<h2>Bike Prediction Analysis</h2>
This project focuses on analyzing bike-sharing data to predict the number of bike rentals based on various features. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the demand for bikes, allowing bike-sharing companies to optimize their operations and better meet customer needs.

<h2>Dataset</h2>
The dataset used in this project contains historical bike-sharing data, including information such as date, time, weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and the number of bike rentals. The dataset is typically divided into training and testing sets, where the training set is used to train the prediction model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

<h2>Data Analysis and Feature Engineering</h2>
Before building the prediction model, the dataset undergoes data analysis and feature engineering to extract meaningful insights and transform the raw data into useful features. Some of the tasks performed in this phase include:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the dataset to understand the distributions, correlations, and patterns in the data. EDA helps identify outliers, missing values, or data quality issues that need to be addressed.

Feature Selection: Select the relevant features that have the most impact on bike rental demand. This step involves assessing the correlation between features and the target variable and considering domain knowledge.

Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve the model's predictive power. For example, extracting information from the date and time features (e.g., day of the week, hour of the day) can help capture temporal patterns in bike rentals.

<h2>Model Building and Evaluation</h2>
Several machine learning algorithms can be used for bike rental prediction, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting algorithms. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the selected algorithm is trained on the training set. The trained model is then evaluated on the testing set to assess its performance. Common evaluation metrics include mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), or R-squared (R2) score.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
In conclusion, this project involves the analysis and prediction of bike rentals using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical bike-sharing data and developing predictive models, bike-sharing companies can better understand and anticipate the demand for bikes. This knowledge enables them to optimize their operations, allocate resources efficiently, and enhance the overall customer experience.
